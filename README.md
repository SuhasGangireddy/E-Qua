Aquaculture is one of the thriving areas in many countries in the world since demand for fish and prawns are expanding day by day. Aquaculture consists of the set of exercises, information and techniques for the rearing of aquatic animal group. Commercial aquaculture is confronting numerous issues because of sudden climatic changes which is leading to changes in water quality parameters. Therefore, monitoring and taking actions to maintain the habitatâ€™s sustainable environment for certain fish species inside of fishing ponds over distributed machine to machine communication, which will ensure quality by handling the PH . In this project we use a functional IOT system for monitoring fish farming ponds. The IoT system consists of various sensors that measure important factors of the water quality like PH level and many more factors.
